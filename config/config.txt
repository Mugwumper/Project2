comments are not permitted in json files so I've deleted the lines we don't need instead.

the following is a copy of the original config.json after editing to comment the lines we don't need yet.

{
  "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "dreamjournal_db",
    "host": "localhost",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  //// these are disabled until we need them
  },
     "test": {
       "username": "root",
       "password": null,
       "database": "testdb",
       "host": "localhost",
       "dialect": "mysql",
       "logging": false
     },
     "production": {
       "use_env_variable": "JAWSDB_URL",
       "dialect": "mysql"
  }
}
